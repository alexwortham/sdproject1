\section{Design Process}

% % @DocumentRequirement (6.1,"Narrative describing how the design proceeded
% from analysis of the requirements to final result.")
Upon analysis of the requirements, we decided that the requirements fell into
one of three categories:  user interaction, autonomous functions, and operating
environment.  Of these three categories, our primary concern was to make user
interaction with the product minimal and free of frustration.  Thus our
discussions began with the question, how do we want the user to interact with
our product?  This question shaped our thinking as we approached the rest of the
requirements.  The primary issue that came to light in researching our
competitors was product configuration.  Every product currently on the market
uses some form of boundary wires for configuration which must be installed in
very strict ways for proper operation of the product.  Next on the list was
obstacle detection and avoidance.  To our great surprise, no competitors on the
market have obstacle detection other than simple collision sensors.

The greatest impact of this lack of features is on the user.  The user must
spend a significant amount of time on product installation, and must clear the
area of all obstacles before each mowing cycle.  We quickly arrived at the
conclusion that this lack of features was due to a lack of intelligent
autonomous design in existing products.  Thus it became clear that in order to
relieve the user from these burdens we needed to focus our efforts on developing
 an intelligent autonomous design capable of tackling these issues.

We knew that if we could meet our objective with the autonomous design that the
remaining categories would pose comparatively less challenge in research and
development.  Nevertheless there were still some important issues that needed to
be addressed. All technological issues aside, we were lost when it came to the
issue of cutting grass.  We needed to know what type of blade would best suit
our design, knowing that this choice would have a major impact upon safety
concerns.  And finally, what standards can we implement for weather proofing?

%% @DocumentRequirement (6.1.1,"Describe how the effort was decomposed into manageable pieces to address the agreed-upon requirements.")
With these issues in mind we were able to develop a clear division of labor.  We
divided up our efforts into the categories of user experience, autonomous
design, and mechanical design.  Our lead software developer, Alex Wortham, in
cooperation with solutions architect, Alex Chaloux, took responsibility of
evaluating various autonomous solutions and their implications on user
experience.  Our team lead and hardware designer, Doug Bouler, looked into the
impacts that the mechanical design would have on our electronics platforms as
well as the implementation of these two.  These members' success was facilitated
by our skilled lead researcher and hardware tester, Asanga Bandara, who also
assisted all of us in our tasks.

%% @DocumentRequirement (6.1.2,"What open questions had to be answered by research?")
%% @DocumentRequirement (6.1.3,"What alternatives were explored?")
Of the many questions posed by these challenges, we were most perplexed by how
we would simplify product configuration.  Configuration of our competitor's
products takes in the order of hours, and it was our goal to reduce the
configuration process to the order of minutes.  The key to solving this complex
problem was solving the considerably more complex problem of high precision
localization of a mobile robotics platform.  Research efforts quickly revealed
there is no de facto standard for localization, and furthermore that there is no
simple solution to this highly complex problem.

Research turned up dozens of scholarly and IEEE papers detailing solutions with
varying levels of success but generally poor precision.  Precision localization
of our product is absolutely vital to compete with the precision of the boundary
wire solution.  Finally we found a solution which can be adapted to achieve the
necessary level of precision without adding high costs. \autocite{mobilegps}  We
believe that by supplementing the odometry found in this method with
accelerometers and gyroscopes we can achieve significantly improved drift
compensation. Granted this ability for high precision localization, we arrived
at a simple configuration process that relies on recording the robot's locations
along a path traversed in a user assisted learning mode.

Our next line of questioning was regarding obstacle avoidance.  What are the
best methods of obstacle detection?  Which methods can be implemented within our
cost constraints?  We considered options such as computer vision, infrared,
ultrasonic, and simple mechanical sensors.  Each of these options present their
own challenges, especially in outdoors environments.  Computer vision and
infrared both rely upon certain characteristic properties of light reflecting
off of obstacles in their detection range.  These properties are too easily
impacted by changes in lighting conditions which are inherent to outdoors
environments, making it difficult to implement a solution which can provide
consistent detection.

Our preliminary research suggests that ultrasonic sensors will be able to
provide the most consistent obstacle detection.  Simple mechanical sensors alone
have proven to be insufficient by our competitors. Even so our design will most
likely incorporate some form of mechanical sensors as a fallback detection
system, but more research on the shortcomings of ultrasonic sensors will be
required in order to assess what the best supplemental detection system would
be.

Another area of concern was the selection of a cutting blade which is effective
and safe.  Most existing autonomous products use a fixed blade system similar to
those found on most human operated mowers, and thereby inherit the same safety
concerns.  In our research we determined that this definitely is not the focus
area of innovation for autonomous mowers. The \textit{Husqvarna
Automower}\autocite{automower} however stands out with an innovative blade
design which, if allowed by applicable intellectual property laws, we would
borrow upon for our own design.

Weather proofing is a difficult subject with any product, as nothing can be
truly weather \textit{proof}.  In a search for a more reasonable, testable set
of requirements for weather \textit{resistance}, we sought out publicized
industry standards to suit our product's needs.  Research led us to two widely
accepted standards published by the National Electrical Manufacturers
Association (NEMA) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).  The
two standards which most appropriately suit our needs are NEMA Enclosure Type
3R\autocite{nema3r}, and IEC International Protection Marking (IP) Code
25.\autocite{ip25}  These standards comprise a set of specifications which
should more than suitably cover our customer's initial requirement, ``It must be
able to survive in Knoxville, TN, weather."

%% @DocumentRequirement (6.1.4,"Describe the selected solution.")
\subsection{Detailed Description of Individual Solutions}
Now to talk a little bit more in detail about how all of this is supposed to
come together we must first look more closely at our chosen solutions for power,
configuration, navigation, and drive components. 

\subsubsection{Power}
Solar power.

\subsubsection{Configuration}

Our chosen solution for configuration of the product guides the user through a
simple process.  Once learning mode has been enabled from the user
interface, the mower will guide the user through an iterative process.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Guide the mower around the absolute boundaries of an area to mow.
  
  		The mower will be propelled under its own power, and the user will only need
  		to steer the mower by a push bar similar to an ordinary self propelled push
  		mower.  The only requirement for successful configuration is that the path
  		traversed by the user must be closed, meaning that the process will end when
  		the user arrives back at the position from which they began.  The user will
  		be notified by the mower when the path has been closed.
  		
  \item Guide the mower around any areas which are enclosed by the area to be
  mowed which should not be mowed.
  
  		The general use case for this is to guide the mower around large, permanent
  		obstacles inside the area to mow.  After completing the first step, users
  		will be prompted to outline these obstacles.  After placing the mower at the
  		edge of the obstacle, the user will push a button to begin path tracing. 
  		Once again, the mower must be guided in a closed path around the obstacle. 
  		The user will be notified when the path has been closed.
  
  \item (Optional) Add reachably disjoint areas to be mowed.
  
        A reachably disjoint area is an area which is not connected to any other area,
        but there exists a path by which the mower can reach it without
        assistance.  If a reachably disjoint area exists, the user
        may add the area by repeating steps 1 - 2, and then initiate a process to trace the path the mower
        will use to cross between disjoint areas.
        
  \item (Optional) Add unreachably disjoint areas to be mowed.
  
        Areas which are unreachably disjoint, meaning it is impossible for the
        mower to navigate between them without assistance, may be defined by
        repeating the above steps. The user will be notified during the mowing
        process when the mower needs assistance to reach these additional areas.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Navigation}

To faciliate this configuration process highly precise localization is needed.
Our answer to this problem is a custom solution fusing multiple existing
technologies to achieve accuracies within ten centimeters.  The basic idea for
our solution is derived from a differential GPS (DGPS) solution presented at
\textit{The Australian Conference on Robotics and Automation}.  This paper
entitled ``High Precision GPS Guidance of Mobile Robots'' details a unqiue
method of localization which ``\ldots\ gathers raw measurement data from two
[low cost] receivers and compares carrier phase data to obtain accuracies
normally associated with the much more costly Real Time Kinematics (RTK)
systems.''\autocite{mobilegps}  This however is not a complete solution to
localization because of the latencies associated with acquiring signal data
from low cost receivers.  

Some form of fallback guidance must take control
during the acquisition periods and any periods in which a location cannot be
acquired.  The solution presented in this paper uses odometry, measuring the
current speed of travel, to interpolate intermediary location data.  The problem
with this is that any slippage of the wheels introduces significant error
which cannot be corrected until the next location is acquired from GPS.
Our proposed solution to this is to use a combination of accelerometers and
gyroscopes for interpolating location data.  These sensors can be acquired for
very low cost, and even in a package which combines readings from the two into
acceleration vectors that can be read by a microcontroller such as an Arduino. 
These readings can be read at X frequency, which will present almost
instantaneous changes in the acceleration vectors that can be used to greatly
reduce error introduced by the slippage problem.
  
During the configuration process location data acquired from our custom
localization solution will be recorded to internal storage in learning mode, and
will be used during the mowing process to help the mower navigate through its
configured area.  It is widely known that in machine learning systems even the
smallest change in the environment can render the machine incapable of
completing the task it was trained to do.  In order to combat this problem, we
need to incorporate a sophistaced obstacle avoidance system to help the mower
navigate around obstacles which were not defined during the configuration
process.
\subsubsection{Obstacle Avoidance}
Ulrasonic.
\subsubsection{Drive Components}
Uh whatever.

\section{Lessons Learned}

%% @DocumentRequirement (7.1,"Describe what went wrong or unexpected events and how the team adapted to these.")

We were fortunate enough to avoid any major mishaps throughout the project. In
forming our group it was important to all of us that our team remain small.
Delightfully our team of four has personalities that mesh well, and that has
enabled us to function as a cohesive unit with no internal strife.
%% @DocumentRequirement (7.2,"What would the team like to see done differently in future projects?")
If there is anything that could be improved upon we would have to choose
communication.  The four of us recognize that we each lead our own busy lives,
and as such we respect the fact that important emails or texts may occaisonally
go unanswered.

\section{Team Member Contributions}

\subsection{Administrative Roles}
%% @DocumentRequirement (8.1,"Describe the responsibilities of each team member.")
Our team lead is Doug Bouler. Doug is in charge of coordinating group
meetings, dividing up labor on assignments, maintaining contact with our
customer, and ensuring that deadlines are met.  Alex Wortham stepped up to the
plate to ensure that all of our group's written deliverables met the
requirements of the assignments.  His experience in \LaTeX\ was invaluable in
ensuring that our documents complied with the given style requirements.  The
decision to adopt \LaTeX\ for all of our project documentation was highly
conducive to the use of source control.  With that in mind Wortham set up and
maintained a Github project to host our documentation and allow for easy
collaboration as well as peace of mind that our documentation was safely backed
up in many locations.

\subsection{Other Roles}
These administrative roles aside, our team does not
believe in the strict assignment of roles to individuals.  When it comes to the
meat of all our work every member has contributed to all aspects of the project.
Through the use of this approach to our work we found the diversity in our
academic disciplines contributed to better outcomes than the work we were
capable of producing individually.
