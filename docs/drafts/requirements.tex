% When you need to reference one requirement from another, first label
% the target requirement with \label{aName} and then you can get that
% requirement's number with \ref{aName}. label need not occur before ref,
% and you must compile the document TWICE to see updated references.

% GOTCHAS:
%
% $, #, &, % are special characters in LaTeX, you must escape them with \
% Use \$, \#, \&, \% respectively.
%
% Do not use ^ or _, or if you must consult the almighty Google for help.
%
% Quotes are weird in LaTeX, ' and " produce right quotes,
% ` and `` produce left quotes. E.G. `single quotes' ``double quotes".
