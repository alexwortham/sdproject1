# Senior Design Project 1

Documentation

  - Documentation is in docs/
    - Final draft documents are kept here.
  - Draft documentation is in docs/drafts/
    - The .gitignore in this directory ignores all output files generated by latex, including .pdf's. You can use this as your working directory when editing draft documentation.
    - Use the provided compileReqs.sh or compileReqs.bat to compile the requirements into a .pdf.
      - The compileReqs.sh script is more advanced than its .bat counterpart. You can use --publish switch to copy the outputted .pdf into docs/. And you can use --view switch to launch the evince pdf viewer.
